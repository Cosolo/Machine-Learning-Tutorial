    "Machine learning is the general term for when computers learn from data.\n",
    "There are lots of different ways (\"algorithms\") that machines can learn. \n",
    "The algorithms can be grouped into supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement algorithms.\n",
    "The data that you feed to a machine learning algorithm can be input-output pairs or just inputs.\n",
    "Supervised learning algorithms require input-output pairs (i.e. they require the output).\n",
    "Unsupervised learning requires only the input data (not the outputs).\n",

    "- you feed it an example input, then the associated output\n",

    "#### Machine Learning Process:\n",
    "1.  ***Data Collection***: Collect the data that the algorithm will learn from.\n",
    "2.  ***Data Preparation***: Format and engineer the data into the optimal format, extracting important features and performing dimensionaility reduction.\n",
    "3.  ***Training***: Also known as the fitting stage, this is where the Machine Learning algorithm actually learns by showing it the data that has been collected and prepared.\n",
    "4.  ***Evaluation***: Test the model to see how well it performs.\n",
    "5.  ***Tuning***: Fine tune the model to maximise it’s performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples\n",
    "Example 1: Facebook recognizes your friend in a picture from an album of tagged photographs\n",
    "Explanation: It is ***supervised learning***. Here Facebook is using tagged photos to recognize the person. Therefore, the tagged photos become the labels of the pictures and we know that when the machine is learning from labelled data, it is supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2: Recommending new songs based on someone’s past music choices\n",
    "Explanation: It is ***supervised learning***. The model is training a classifier on pre-existing labels (genres of songs).\n",
    "This is what Netflix, Pandora, and Spotify do all the time, they collect the songs/movies that you like already, evaluate the features based on your likes/dislikes and then recommend new movies/songs based on similar features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 3: Analyze bank data for suspicious looking transactions and flag the fraud transactions\n",
    "Explanation: It is ***unsupervised learning***. In this case, the suspicious transactions are not defined, hence there are no labels of \"fraud\" and \"not fraud\". The model tries to identify outliers by looking at anomalous transactions and flags them as 'fraud'.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Deep learning \n",
    "\n",
    "A subset of machine learning, composing algorithms that allow a model to train itself and perform tasks. In other words, DL is the next evolution of machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "DL algorithms are roughly inspired by the information processing patterns found in the human brain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like we use our brains to identify patterns and classify various types of information, deep learning algorithms can be taught to accomplish the same tasks for machines.\n",
    "The brain usually tries to decipher the information it receives. It achieves this through labelling and assigning the items into various categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever we receive a new information, the brain tries to compare it to a known item before making sense of it — which is the same concept deep learning algorithms employ.\n",
    "For example, while DL can automatically discover the features to be used for classification, ML requires these features to be provided manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, in contrast to ML, DL needs high-end machines and considerably big amounts of training data to deliver accurate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Artificial inteligence \n",
    "\n",
    "A technique which enables machines to mimic human behavior\n",
    "Types of AI :\n",
    "- Reactive Machines: systems that only react, doesn't use past experience\n",
    "- Limited Memory\n",
    "- Theory of Mind: systems able to understand human emotions and interact\n",
    "- Self-awareness: predicting other people's feelings and act apptopriately\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever a machine completes tasks based on a set of stipulated rules that solve problems (algorithms), such an “intelligent” behavior is what is called artificial intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, such machines can move and manipulate objects, recognize whether someone has raised the hands, or solve other problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "AI-powered machines are usually classified into two groups — general and narrow. The general artificial intelligence AI machines can intelligently solve problems, like the ones mentioned above.\n",
