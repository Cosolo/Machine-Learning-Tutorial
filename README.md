My Machine Learning Tutorial Diary

This is a diary of my work on Machine Learning tutorial videos for the course Disruptive Technologies.
I have combined youtube tutorials and other sources (listed in every notebook) where I felt i needed better examples/visualizations or explanations.

The idea is that this set of notebooks becomes my cheat - sheets for basic ML algorithms.

Each notebook contains:
- a theoretical part with information from various sources and my notes
- application of each algorithm on various examples (all datasets available in folder '/data')

## Overview

1. [Introduction to Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence](https://github.com/Cosolo/Machine-Learning-Tutorial/blob/master/Machine%20Learning%2C%20Deep%20Learning%2C%20AI%20-%20INFO.ipynb)
2. [Decision Tree Algorithm](https://github.com/Cosolo/Machine-Learning-Tutorial/blob/master/Decision%20Tree%20Algorithm.ipynb)
3. [K-Means Clustering](https://github.com/Cosolo/Machine-Learning-Tutorial/blob/master/K-Means%20clustering.ipynb)
4. [K-Nearest Neighbor](https://github.com/Cosolo/Machine-Learning-Tutorial/blob/master/K-Nearest%20Neighbor.ipynb)
5. [Linear Regression](https://github.com/Cosolo/Machine-Learning-Tutorial/blob/master/Linear%20Regression.ipynb)
6. [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/Cosolo/Machine-Learning-Tutorial/blob/master/Logistic%20Regression.ipynb)
7. [Naive Bayes](https://github.com/Cosolo/Machine-Learning-Tutorial/blob/master/Naive%20Bayes.ipynb)
8. [Random Forest](https://github.com/Cosolo/Machine-Learning-Tutorial/blob/master/Random%20Forest.ipynb)
9. [Support Vector Machines](https://github.com/Cosolo/Machine-Learning-Tutorial/blob/master/Support%20Vector%20Machines.ipynb)

I hope someone will find it useful!
