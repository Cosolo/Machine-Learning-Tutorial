My Machine Learning Tutorial Diary

This is a diary of my work on Machine Learning tutorial videos for the course Disruptive Technologies.
I have combined youtube tutorials and other sources (listed in every notebook) where I felt i needed better examples/visualizations or explanations.

The idea is that this set of notebooks becomes my cheat - sheets for basic ML algorithms.
